# Creative Practice 1 – CDPS

This repository contains the implementation of **Creative Practice 1** for the course **CDPS** (Concepts and Design of Digital Systems).

The objective of this practice is to apply the concepts introduced in the course through a creative and practical approach, combining system design, implementation, and analysis.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on:
- Applying theoretical concepts from CDPS to a practical scenario
- Designing and implementing a functional solution
- Analyzing the behavior and results of the system
- Encouraging creativity while respecting the technical constraints of the assignment

All the code and resources required to understand and execute the practice are included in this repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
├── src / main files # Source code of the practice
├── data (if applicable) # Input data or resources
└── README.md # Project description


*(The exact structure may vary depending on the implementation.)*

## Documentation

A detailed written report (memory) was produced as part of the original academic submission.  
However, **it is not included in this repository** in order to preserve the privacy and personal data of the students involved.

This GitHub repository is shared **voluntarily** as a technical reference and portfolio piece, focusing exclusively on the implementation aspects of the project.

## How to Run

If applicable:
1. Ensure the required dependencies are installed
2. Run the main file or notebook according to the project instructions
3. Adjust parameters or input data as needed

Further details can be inferred directly from the source code and comments.

## Notes

- This repository is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes
- The implementation reflects the author’s individual contribution
- Any sensitive or personal information has been deliberately omitted
